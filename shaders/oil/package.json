    "description": "Physics-based thin film interference. FBM surface normals drive both UV refraction and per-wavelength phase offset, producing the characteristic shifting rainbow of a soap bubble or oil slick. Hue of underlying content rotates with film thickness. Specular highlight and edge darkening for pooling depth. Fully self-contained.",
